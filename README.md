# manusoft-winpatch
Utilities for code and memory patching on Windows (Intel x86/x64 only)

This collection of classes and utilities was designed for low level code and
PE module patching from Windows user mode at runtime. Sorry, there is no
documentation.

Many of these classes were written before 2000. Very little effort has been
made to modernize this old code, however much of it is still in active use.

Note: the DisAsm library contains a working VS 2022 test project that builds
all the files in this collection:
